# Carousel

### Problem Statement:
Build a responsive carousel that has:
- **Previous and Next buttons** to navigate between slides.
- **Auto change image** every 4 seconds, so the carousel moves automatically without user interaction.

### Additional Features (Optional):
- Add **indicators** (e.g., dots) that represent the current slide.
- Include **pause/resume** functionality when hovering over the carousel.
