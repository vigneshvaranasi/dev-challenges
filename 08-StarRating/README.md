# Start Rating

Build a star rating component that allows users to **select a rating** interactively, and can be reused multiple times on the same page with different configurations.
  
- Clicking a star should:
  - Fill that star and all stars to its left.
  - Update the selected rating value.

- Hovering over the stars should:
  - Temporarily fill that star and all stars to its left.
  - Override the previously selected rating during hover.
  - Revert back to the selected rating after the mouse leaves the widget.
